  "readme": "# Colorblind Wombat Dark Syntax theme\n\nThis theme was created for the [__Atom text editor__](https://atom.io/) in an attempt to allow colorblind people to differentiate the text easily.\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Colorblind Wombat Dark Syntax theme Markdown screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11855476/20028863/e50b94c6-a30a-11e6-8d66-30deb5f99e0e.png)\n\n## Specialized support for the following languages\n* __css__\n* __javascript__\n* __json__\n* __markdown__\n* __php__\n* __python__\n\nWhile it should work with any language that Atom supports, languages that I don't use haven't been tested yet.\n\n## Motivation\n\nI, like millions of other people, suffer from colorblindness. I wanted a theme that was highly visible, let me distinguish as many colors as possible, and wouldn't strain either my eyes or the eyes of someone that sees color.\n\nIn my search for the perfect theme, I couldn't find one that was just right. After trying a plethora of themes, I began tweaking some of the better ones. I eventually found a theme that was close enough to work with. I forked that theme and began the modifications to make it compatible with all different types of vision.\n\n## Colorblind Wombat Dark Syntax theme creation\n\nThe closest theme I found that would work for my eyes was the [__Wombat Dark Syntax__](https://atom.io/themes/wombat-dark-syntax) theme. The files used to create the __Wombat Dark Syntax__ theme were already wonderfully customized to the languages that I wanted to use. There were a few things that I didn't like about the theme, but the structure was there to make the creation of my own theme easy.\n\n__Colorblind Wombat Dark Syntax__ theme is created from a fork of __Wombat Dark Syntax__ theme combined with the default syntax theme and an extended [\"conservative 7-color palettes for color blindness\"](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/colorblind/). The \"conservative 7-color palettes for colorblindness\" is a grouping of colors that is designed to be distinguishable by anyone regardless of color vision. While I had to use more colors than available in the 7-color palette, I hope that the additions will work for all types of colorblindness.\n\n## Feedback requested\n\nIf you are using the theme and are having difficulty with the colors, please report the issue [here](https://github.com/mdburnes/colorblind-wombat-dark-syntax/issues) so that I can attempt to tweak the color palette for the widest possible audience.\n\n## Further work planned\n\nNone currently planned.\n",
