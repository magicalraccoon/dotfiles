## Weights, Variants and OpenType features

The typeface contains seven weights (thin, extra-light, light, regular, medium, bold and heavy) alongside with both italic and oblique versions, with the same metrics as the regular one. 

![Weights sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/be5invis/Iosevka/master/images/weights.png)

All versions include the same ranges of characters: Latin letters, Greek letters (including Polytonic), some Cyrillic letters, IPA symbols and common punctuations and some symbols. You can check out the full list [here](http://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/specimen.html).

![Languages Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/be5invis/Iosevka/master/images/languages.png)

### Ligations

![Ligations Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/be5invis/Iosevka/master/images/ligations.png)

Iosevka’s default ligation set is assigned to `calt` feature, though not all of them are enabled by default.

Iosevka supports Language-Specific Ligations, which is the ligation set enabled only under certain languages. These ligation sets are assigned to custom feature tags, like `XHS0`.

## Building from Source

To build Iosevka you should:

1. Ensure that [`nodejs`](http://nodejs.org) (≥ 8.4), [`ttfautohint`](http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/), [`otfcc`](https://github.com/caryll/otfcc) (≥ 0.9.3) and GNU `make` (≥ 4.1; BSD `make` may not work) are runnable in your terminal.
   - Windows users may need to install MinGW and make POSIX utilities accessible (`mkdir.exe`, `cp.exe`, `cat.exe` and `rm.exe`, in particular) from Command Prompt. Utilities provided by [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) or MSYS2 works fine.
2. Install necessary libs by `npm install`. If you’ve installed them, upgrade to the latest.
3. `make` (or `gmake`).


You will find TTFs in the `dist/` directory.

### Building the Web Font

The `webfonts/` directory is used to build Iosevka for web font uses. To build the web fonts you should:

1. Build Iosevka.
2. Ensure that `sfnt2woff` and `woff2_compress` are installed and runnable.
3. Run `make web` .

The web fonts will be generated into `dist/iosevka/web` and `dist/iosevka-slab/web`.

## Build Your Own Style

![Styles Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/be5invis/Iosevka/master/images/variants.png)

Iosevka comes with several visual styles, however they are inactive using the default build. To build these variants, you should perform custom build:

1. `make custom-config [set=<name>]` with the parameters listed below to create a configuration. The `set=<name>` part is optional, it will be set to `custom` when absent.
2. `make custom [set=<name>]` to acquire your custom font.
   - `make custom-web [set=<name>]` is for web fonts.

The first step, `make custom-config` takes following parameters to set styles of your custom build. All of them are optional, and would default to Iosevka’s default configuration:

* `design='<styles>'`, styles for your custom font set.
* `upright='<styles>'`, styles for uprights only.
* `italic='<styles>'`, styles for italics only.
* `oblique='<styles>'`, styles for obliques only.

You can add arbitary styles for these variables, for example, `make custom-config upright='v-l-zshaped v-i-zshaped' && make custom` will create a variant with Z-shaped letter `l` and `i` for uprights.

The current available styles are:

* Styles for general shape:
  * `sans` : Sans serif (default).
  * `slab` : Slab serif. When present, the family of your font would be `Iosevka Slab`.
* Styles related to ligations and spacing:
  - `term` : Disable ligations. When this style is present, the font built will not contain ligatures, and its family name will be set to “`Iosevka Term`”. In case of your OS or editor cannot handle ligatures correctly, you can disable ligations with it.
  - `type` : Make some symbols, like arrows (`→`) and mathematical operators full-width.
  - `stress-fw` : When included, full-width characters varying form `U+FF00` to `U+FFFF` will be boxed to present a clear distinguish between ASCII and Full-width. The family name will be set to “`Iosevka StFW`”.
* All registered `ss##` and `cv##` feature tags, including:
  * `ss01`~`ss10` : Predefined stylistic sets based on other Monospace fonts.
  * `cv01`~`cv45` : Standalone character variants.
* Styles for ligation sets, include:
  * `ligset-haskell`: Default ligation set would be assigned to Haskell.
  * `ligset-idris`: Default ligation set would be assigned to Idris.
  * `ligset-coq`: Default ligation set would be assigned to Coq.
  * `ligset-elm`: Default ligation set would be assigned to Elm.
  * `ligset-ml`: Default ligation set would be assigned to ML.
  * `ligset-fs`: Default ligation set would be assigned to F#.
  * `ligset-fstar`: Default ligation set would be assigned to F\*.
  * `ligset-swift`: Default ligation set would be assigned to Swift.
  * `ligset-purescript`: Default ligation set would be assigned to PureScript.

    * `v-l-hooky` : Hooky `l`.

    * `v-t-standard` : Standard `t` shape (default).
    * `v-t-cross` : Futura-like `t` shape.
  * Styles for letter `Q`:
    * `v-q-taily` : `Q` with a curly tail (default).

![Family Matrix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/be5invis/Iosevka/master/images/matrix.png)

## Which font?

### TL;DR

* Pick your font family and then select from the `'complete'` directory.
  * If you are on Windows pick a font with the `'Windows Compatible'` suffix.
    * This includes specific tweaks to ensure the font works on Windows, in particular monospace identification and font name length limitations
  * If you are limited to monospaced fonts (because of your terminal, etc) then pick a font with the `'Mono'` suffix.
    * This denotes that the Nerd Font glyphs will be monospaced not necessarily that the entire font will be monospaced

### Explanation

Once you narrow down your font choice of family (`Droid Sans`, `Inconsolata`, etc) and style (`bold`, `italic`, etc) you have 2 main choices:

#### `Option 1: Download already patched font`

 * download an already patched font from the `complete` folder
   * This is most likely the one you want. It includes **all** of the glyphs from all of the glyph sets. Only caution here is that some fonts have glyphs in the _same_ code point so to include everything some had to be moved to alternate code points.

#### `Option 2: Patch your own font`

 * patch your own variations with the various options provided by the font patcher (see each font's readme for full list of combinations available)
   * This is the option you want if the font you use is _not_ already included or you want maximum control of what's included
   * This contains a list of _all permutations_ of the various glyphs. E.g. You want the font with only [Octicons][octicons] or you want the font with just [Font Awesome][font-awesome] and [Devicons][vorillaz-devicons]. The goal is to provide every combination possible in this folder.
